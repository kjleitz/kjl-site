                <h2>Welcome to my temporary website!</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Keegan Leitz. I'm a human being who's interested 
                    in things, generally. More specifically, I'm a person with
                    an official degree in chemistry, and an unofficial degree in 
                    being dissatisfied with where he is right now. Even more specifically,
                    I'm a dude with a website which, ultimately, doesn't say anything,
                    but <i>does</i> help him practice web design and development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to poke around. You might encounter a bug where no links
                    work except for the "Home", "Wikipedia", and "GitHub" ones. Good job!
                    But before you feel good about yourself, feel bad about yourself.
                    Because that is not a bug! It is a <i>feature</i>. A <i>feature</i> of 
                    me never actually putting links there. 
                </p>
                <p><i>Ahem.</i></p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, check out the neat top bar. Nice little javascript trigger
                    for some CSS animations. You can see some other CSS animations if you 
                    hover over the links at the bottom of the page. If you view this 
                    site on your phone, or if you resize your window to a narrow width, you 
                    will also see a neat javascript-and-CSS navigation
                    menu. <i>Good stuff.</i> I also invite you to admire the simple, minimalist
                    design that I am arrogantly and, most importantly, <b>irrationally</b> 
                    proud of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can view the code for this site on GitHub 
                    <a href="https://github.com/kjleitz/kjl-site">here</a>, or inspect it 
                    with your browser, if you'd like. Also, feel free to read the nonsense
                    I have prepared for you in the form of placeholder text below.
                </p>
                <p>Thanks for visiting!</p>

                <h2>This is a whole heading!</h2>
                <p>Aaaaaand this is content. Hello content. What a world we live in!
                Full of great content just like this. Why, I feel like I could just
                write an entire paragraph of useless but beautiful content, just for 
                testing purposes alone. I'm serious! Imagine that, would you? 
                Entirely for testing purposes! A man would normally go and copy a 
                bit of Lorem Ipsum straight off of <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, but not this man. This
                man does things RIGHT.</p>
                <p> Here's another <i>paragraph</i> even. I can't even imagine the
                enormous waste of time the author is diddling away. Who does he 
                think he is, writing all this here. I'd smack him. What a worthless
                piece of human garbage. Why did he even bother waking up this 
                morning?</p>
